SH.PRG.ANEM,CC BY-4.0,Prevalence of anemia among pregnant women (%),"Prevalence of anemia, pregnant women, is the percentage of pregnant women whose hemoglobin level is less than 110 grams per liter at sea level.","World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository/World Health Statistics.",Health: Nutrition,Annual,Weighted average,"Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to meet physiologic needs, which vary by age, sex, altitude, smoking status, and pregnancy status. In its severe form it is associated with fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and drowsiness. Children under age 5 and pregnant women have the highest risk for anemia.","Data should be used with caution because surveys differ in quality, coverage, age group interviewed, and treatment of missing values across countries and over time.

Data on anemia are compiled by the WHO based mainly on nationally representative surveys, which measure hemoglobin in the blood. WHO's hemoglobin thresholds are then used to determine anemia status based on age, sex, and physiological status.",https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
